Fixing time problems is probably one of the most satisfying things to fix
programmatically for me. It is one of those things where you may spend ages
stabbing in the dark with different time zones, formats, etc etc. - but there
it really is satisfying when you do get it right and what you see in your code
is what you see on your clock.
Weird, but true.
