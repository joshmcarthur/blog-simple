[The Dictionary of New Zealand Sign Language](http://nzsl.vuw.ac.nz) went live
on Friday - it's a project that I have worked on with [Daniel](http://
www.danielsherson.com), Chris and [James R](http://www.linkedin.com/in/
jamesarobertson), at 3Months. I attended a launch event at Victoria University
on the Friday, and it really was quite a humbling experience - this dictionary
has been the effort of a team of people for years and years - really, what
3Months has done has just been the tip of the iceberg. It really does seem like
this project has been rewarding - we've taken a comprehensive database of sign
information and images (Built with what seems to be a lot of time and effort by
[Dave Moskozitz](http://dave.moskovitz.co.nz/2011/06/24/the-online-dictionary-
of-new-zealand-sign-language/)), and given it a public presence - hopefully,
something that everyone can use - whether it's to learn New Zealand Sign
Language, or just to learn how to finger spell names and words. I'm mostly
posting this in the hope that everyone who reads this goes to check out the
site, and to learn something of this language - give it a spin! [http://
