Finding appropriate domain names is a chore. There are so many rubbish parking
sites out there that just ... shouldn't be. I dare sayjoshmcarthur.me could be
considered one of them, since I could easily offload this onto Tumblr, but I
enjoy having the unlimited capabilities a hosted site allows.
I think that domains should be treated in a similar way to Patents when they
are registered. Patents require the applicant to justify to an overall
authority (the Intellectual_Property_Office in NZ), why they should be allowed
to own a particular patent.
If there was a justification scheme in place, it would not restrict the people
who need domains - they would simply have to specify why they need the domain.
What it would do is provide a decision framework on which to base decisions on
registering domains to domain agents.
Why tie up a perfectly good address? Leave them open, and truly make it first-
in, first-served, instead of the 'richest wins' model that exists at the
moment.
