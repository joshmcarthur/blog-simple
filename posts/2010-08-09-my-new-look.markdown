Do you like my revamped theme? I think it's totally cool to have this type of
timeline in a microblog like Tumblr - it makes things really easy to flip
through... don't you want to keep pressing the arrows?
It's this_theme, but I tweaked the CSS a bit and added some jQuery to bind
left/right scrolling to the arrow keys as well as the buttons.
