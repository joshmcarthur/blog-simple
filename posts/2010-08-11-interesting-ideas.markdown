As part of my research for my last-minute essay rewrite, I happened to pick up
an article covering an interview with David_Heinemeier_Hansson, partner at
37signals.com and inventor of Ruby_on_Rails.
Hansson had some very interesting ideas, including the concept of reducing
working hours in favour of creative quality, and the value of constraints over
capital: "Excellent decisions come out of constraints...You must make
compromises and decisions to cut down and release something that's simple and
easy to use".
Hansson also had some interesting thoughts regarding the virtual workplace,
suggesting that employees are happier in an environment of their choice, and a
relaxed managerial style that reduces overhead and emphasises quality over
quantity.
Definitely somebody to keep an eye on!
