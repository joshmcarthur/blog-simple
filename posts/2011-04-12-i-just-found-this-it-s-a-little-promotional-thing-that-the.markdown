I just found this - it's a little promotional thing that the (now non-existent)
VUW (Victoria University of Wellington IT Society) did (Well, me and Eddy) to
try and get people to join up (It worked.) - basically, I built a little IR
pen, and using a Wiimote, we managed to make a nice little giant touchscreen.
Granted, it needed calibrating often, and the correct body posture and hand
position took some finding, but it was definately a fun experiment to try out.
